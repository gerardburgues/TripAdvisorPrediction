# TripAdvisorPrediction

With a given dataset with comments from users and the start rating, my goal will be to predict the rating start when a user enter a comment. 
To do that I'm gonna apply various NLP steps:

1. CREATE DICTIONARY WITH ALL THE WORDS
  1.1 Transform to lowercase
  1.2 Remove stopwords
  1.3 Lemmanization
  1.4 Tokenize
2. Use Sklearn to vectorize and apply TF-IDF to see the value of the words
3. PCA to show graphically the scatter plot of most of the words values (Vectorization)
